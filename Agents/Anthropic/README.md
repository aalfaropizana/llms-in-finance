# How Can You Build a Financial Agentic System Using Anthropic, LlamaIndex, and APIs?

This project leverages Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, LlamaIndex, and the Financial Modeling Prep API to streamline the retrieval of financial data. How does it work, and what can it do?

## The goal
The goal of this agentic system is to allow us to access essential financial data - such as stock prices, income statements, and company's information - and generate deeper insights for decision-making. This leverages on the capabilities of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, one of the most capable LLM, on using tools calling functionality.


## The Process:
- Retrieve Financial Data: With this agentic system, we can fetch stock prices, volume, earnings, and even upcoming announcements.

- Access Comprehensive Company Financials: The system provides key company's information like market capitalization, sector classification, and beta values.

- Generate Income Statements: Easily access annual income statements, including revenue, net income, and EBITDA, for thorough analysis.


## Key Takeaways:
- The system not only retrieves data but also compares it with previous financial performance for more insightful analysis.

- It recalls data from previous queries to fill in missing details.

- Financial data retrieval is faster and more efficient, pulling from multiple endpoints simultaneously.
