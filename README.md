# LLMs-in-Finance
**Exploring how to apply GenAI to real-world financial workflows with AI Agents, RAG, and Multimodal LLMs**

Welcome to the **LLMs-in-Finance** repository!  
Here, you'll find hands-on **Jupyter notebooks** demonstrating how to apply the latest Generative AI tools-like **OpenAI's Agents SDK**, **Anthropic's Claude**, **AutoGen**, **LlamaIndex**, and **CrewAI**-to practical finance use cases.

Whether you're building a multi-agent system to analyze markets, applying RAG to earnings reports, or testing multimodal models on financial charts-this repo is for you!

If you find this work helpful, **please consider giving the repository a star** to support and help others discover it!

## What's Inside?

This repo is structured into the following key areas:

- **[AI Agents in Finance](#ai-agents-in-finance)** - Use frameworks like AutoGen, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI to create collaborative agents for financial analysis.
- **[RAG](#rag)** - Learn to retrieve, parse, and analyze financial documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques.
- **[Multimodals](#multimodals)** - Test how well models like GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 interpret charts in earnings reports.
- **[Papers in Finance](#papers-in-finance)** - A curated summary of research papers on GenAI in financial applications.

Let's dive in!

## [RAG](https://github.com/aalfaropizana/LLMs-in-Finance/tree/main/RAG)

In this section, you'll find several examples with various providers/libraries on how to parse complex financial reports: LlamaIndex, Anthropic, OpenAI, aisuite.

Some interesting notebooks to look at:
*   [Financial Report Analysis with LlamaParse AutoMode](RAG/llamaindex/Financial_Report_Analysis_with_LlamaParse_AutoMode.ipynb)
*   [Prompt Caching With Anthropic](https://github.com/aalfaropizana/LLMs-in-Finance/blob/main/RAG/Anthropic/Anthropic_Prompt_Caching.ipynb)

An example is also included on how to **evaluate** your RAG system with DeepEval, GiskarAI.
